    <h3>British National Grid to XY</h3>
    <p>
      A QGIS plugin for plotting data referenced with the British National Grid
      (BNG) system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Converts BNG two-letter references (0-10 digits) to Cartesian (XY)
      coordinates, adhering to the bottom-left corner convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input: a CSV with at least one record and two fields referring to an 'id'
      and a 'grid reference'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Output: a temporary vector layer (point-geometry) with four fields: 'id',
      'grid reference', 'easting' and 'northing'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional support for plotting the centre of a grid square (counter to
      the bottom-left principle) and for plotting DINTY tetrads is being tested.
